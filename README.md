This is an abandoned experiment where I tried to replicate [Minecraft version rd-132211](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_pre-Classic_rd-132211) in assembly code with the goal to have it run identically to the original game. I looked through the version's source code and LWJGL's source code to replicate its system calls and window settings. I was able to get the world to exist and for the player to walk and turn around in it imperefectly, indicated by their x, y, and z position printed on the command line. I had no OpenGL knowledge when I worked on this project, so I never made any graphics appear. Entering negative coordinates crashes the program.
